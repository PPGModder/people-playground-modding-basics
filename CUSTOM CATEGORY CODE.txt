//NOTE: Go to the top of your script, and paste the categorybuilder code under public static void, here is an example:

------------------------------

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

namespace Mod
{
    public class Mod
    {
        public static void Main()
        {

            CategoryBuilder.Create("CUSTOM NAME HERE", "PUT DESCRIPTION HERE", ModAPI.LoadSprite("THUMBNAIL HERE.png"));
------------------------------

Once you have put that piece of code there, download this file, and put it inside of your mod, you dont
need to edit the file but dont chage the name.

(It's a simple text file)
Also make sure you add the code to your MOD script.
